# own-your-style
Own Your Style is a Flutter mobile application that digitizes a user’s wardrobe by extracting clothing attributes using computer vision.
Outfit selection is modeled as a constrained optimization problem and solved with a genetic algorithm that generates and ranks outfit combinations based on weather, location, event type.
The app pairs a polished Flutter frontend with a Laravel backend service to store items and deliver personalized recommendations.
